# SpectralEngine
## Introduction
A multithreaded game engine that uses data parallelism to distribute work over multiple threads and supports long running tasks. It uses directX 12 for rendering. However, its not in a usable state yet.

## Sopported Platforms
Currently only windows 10 is supported due to the use of directX 12. Adding a Vulkan rendering backend is planed to support more platforms.

## Building
Visual studio 2017 or visual studio 2019 with c++ for windows desktop development installed can be used to build the engine and demo. Building the demo for the first time can take a few minutes.
